# TopSpeedTracker
I was playing around with App development for Assetto Corsa and thought of a neat little tool for myself when doing top speed runs.   I was inspired by the Midnight Club's runs and Wangan Midnight (hence the Nissan Fairlady S30Z "Devil Z" and the Shutoku Highway)


Installation:
1. Install the repository as a zip
2. Extract the zip, take the interior folder (make sure only one exterior folder and the actual app contents are inside that) and paste it in C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\assettocorsa\apps\python
3. In content manager, go to settings > Assetto Corsa > Python Apps
  - Make sure enable python apps is checked, and the Top Speed Tracker app is checked under the Activated Apps: section

4. Launch a session
5. Go to your apps on the side
6. Find "Zad Test"
7. Click it
8. go fast as heck bro ggez スピード
